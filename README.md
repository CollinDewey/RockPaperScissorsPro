# Rock Paper Scissors Pro
Project for CSE 120 Python - Fall 2022

## Running
`python main.py`

## Requirements
This project requires multiple python libraries, which could sometimes cause issues depending on library versions.

If using a venv, install the libraries with pip using requirements.txt.

If you chose not to use a venv, the program should try to use pip to install the needed libraries. This means you will need to have pip installed.

## Notice
Use Python 3.10 since Pygame currently doesn't compile on Python 3.11 and this project relies on networking libraries that are removed in Python 3.12.
