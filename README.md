# Rock Paper Scissors Pro
Project for CSE 120 Python - Fall 2022

## Running
`python main.py`

## Requirements
This project requires multiple python libraries, which could sometimes cause issues depending on library versions.

If using a venv, install the libraries with pip using requirements.txt.

If you chose not to use a venv, the program should try to use pip to install the needed libraries. This means you will need to have pip installed.
